# Kernel Auth Page

This Svelte projects builds to a single `auth.html` with fully-inline JS, CSS and fonts.

## Development

To build, run `npm i` then `npm run build`. For live-development, `npm run dev` is available, and `npm run serve` will serve the latest build file.

Skynet Kernel logic is contained in `./src/lib/helpers.ts` and `./src/libs/skynet.ts`.

The `fonts-minimal.css` file may need replaced if modified text extends beyond a simple character set.
